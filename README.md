## Thermal Elastic Conctraction (TEC) model 

Matlab scripts for calculating ground surface displacements due to thermalelastic contraction. The model was developed by Furuya (2004,2005), who gave the analytical quasi-static solution of ground deformation in response to a instantaneous heat source in an elastic half-space. The model can be applied to infer post-eruptive deformation after magma intrusion or lava emplacement.
